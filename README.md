# Manage Landing Page

Manage Landing Page is a project that I built as part of a coding challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal of the project was to create a responsive landing page for a fictitious project management tool called "Manage".

The landing page features a custom CSS grid system for the main content area and includes a mobile menu that opens and closes with JavaScript. Additionally, the form on the page includes form validation with JavaScript.

The technologies used to build this project include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overall, this project helped me improve my front-end web development skills, particularly in areas such as responsive design and form validation.
